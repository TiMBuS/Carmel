- revert to the use of -L, but make sure it installs to the same (shared) directory over time to speed up installs
- Build artifacts might contain binaries, which should be perl version dependent
- Add Module::CPANfile shortcut to "require" all listed modules for given phase (like Bundler.require)
- runtime checks to detect modules loaded from site_perl by installing @INC hooks
- Add a mechanism to *generate* snapshot like Carton does
